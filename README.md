Got it ✅ I’ll create a **ready-to-use `README.md` file** with **proper explanation + screenshots**. You just need to create a folder called `screenshots/` in your repo and place your screenshots there (rename them properly like `chat-ui.png`, `input-speaker.png`, etc.).

Here’s your **README.md** ⬇️

✅ This file is **ready to copy-paste** as `README.md`.  
Just make sure you:  
- Put your screenshots in a folder named `screenshots/` at the project root.  
- Update the `git clone` URL with your GitHub repo link.  

Do you also want me to **include code snippets (frontend + backend)** inside the README so recruiters can quickly see your implementation without opening files?
